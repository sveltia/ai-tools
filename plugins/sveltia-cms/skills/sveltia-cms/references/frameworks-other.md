## Hugo Integration Guide

This guide provides resources and information for integrating Sveltia CMS with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a popular static site generator.

### Starter Templates

Here are some starter templates built by the community using Hugo:

- [Hugo module](https://github.com/privatemaker/headless-cms) by [privatemaker](https://github.com/privatemaker)
- [Hugolify](https://www.hugolify.io/) by [sebousan](https://github.com/sebousan)

These third-party resources are not necessarily reviewed by the Sveltia CMS team. We are not responsible for their maintenance or support. Please contact the respective authors for any issues or questions.

### Examples

See real-world examples of Hugo integrations in our [Showcase](https://sveltiacms.app/en/showcase?framework=hugo). Most of the listed sites include links to their source code, so you can explore how they implemented Sveltia CMS with Hugo.

### Setup

#### Adding the Admin Page

Hugo serves static files from the [`static` folder](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/). Create `static/admin/index.html` and `static/admin/config.yml` as described in the [Getting Started](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/start#manual-installation) guide. The admin page is then available at `/admin/` on the development server started with `hugo server` as well as on the built site.

### Configuration

Hugo stores content in the `content` folder, and each subfolder is a [section](https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/), such as `content/posts`. The following example manages the posts section, storing each post as a [page bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) with its images in the same folder:

```yaml [static/admin/config.yml]
media_folder: static/images
public_folder: /images
collections:
  - name: posts
    label: Posts
    folder: content/posts
    path: '{{slug}}/index'
    media_folder: ''
    public_folder: ''
    create: true
    fields:
      - { name: title, label: Title }
      - { name: date, label: Date, widget: datetime }
      - { name: draft, label: Draft, widget: boolean, default: true }
      - { name: description, label: Description, required: false }
      - { name: tags, label: Tags, widget: list, required: false }
      - { name: body, label: Body, widget: markdown }
```

Some notes on this configuration:

- The `path` option saves a post as `content/posts/my-post/index.md`, and the empty `media_folder` and `public_folder` options store its images in the same folder. See [Using Entry-Relative Folders](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/media/internal#using-entry-relative-folders) for details. If you prefer single files like `content/posts/my-post.md`, remove these three options, and images are saved in the `static/images` folder defined at the top level instead.
- Posts with `draft: true` are not published unless Hugo runs with the `--buildDrafts` option. The default value above makes new posts drafts, so editors need to turn the option off to publish them. Alternatively, use the [Editorial Workflow](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/workflows/editorial) to review posts before they’re published.
- Hugo supports YAML, TOML and JSON [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/). Sveltia CMS detects the format of existing files automatically and saves new files with YAML front matter by default. Set the collection’s [`format`](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/formats#format) option to `toml-frontmatter` if your site uses TOML.
- Hugo’s `_index.md` files, which hold the content of section list pages, can be managed along with the regular entries using the [`index_file`](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/listings#managing-hugo-s-special-index-file) collection option.

### Support for Hugo

We have implemented specific features to enhance the integration of Sveltia CMS with Hugo:

- [Entry-relative media folders](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/media/internal#using-entry-relative-folders): Store media files in folders relative to their associated entries, which is a common practice in Hugo projects called [page bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/).
- [Nested collections](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/nested): Manage a tree of [sections](https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/) as a folder tree in the sidebar, where each entry is stored as an `_index.md` file in its own folder and can be moved along with its children.
- [Entry redirects](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/previews#redirects): Out-of-the-box support for Hugo’s [`aliases` front matter property](https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases), which is updated when the entry slug is changed in Sveltia CMS.
- [Manual entry reordering](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/operations#reordering-entries): Use the `reorder` option to add the [`weight` property](https://gohugo.io/methods/page/weight/) to entries for controlling their order in Hugo.
- [Index file inclusion](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/listings#managing-hugo-s-special-index-file): Manage Hugo’s [special `_index.md` files](https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/#index-pages-_indexmd) for section entries.
- [Translation by content directory](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/i18n/structures#custom-locale-folder-placement): Put the `{{locale}}` placeholder in a collection’s `folder` option, e.g. `content/{{locale}}/posts`, to match a [multilingual Hugo site](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#translation-by-content-directory) with a `contentDir` per language, section index files included.
- [Localizing entry slugs](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/i18n/slugs#localizing-entry-slugs): Generate localized slugs for [multilingual Hugo sites](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/) using the `translationKey` property of entries.
- [Editor components](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/api/editor-components#examples): Examples of custom components that insert Hugo [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) into Markdown content, such as an image with a caption and a YouTube embed.
- [Time formatting](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/data-output#general-conventions): A standard time is saved as `HH:mm:ss` instead of `HH:mm` for compatibility with Hugo.

## Jekyll Integration Guide

This guide provides resources and information for integrating Sveltia CMS with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a popular static site generator.

### Starter Templates

Here are some starter templates built by the community using Jekyll:

- [Jekyll Blades](https://github.com/anyblades/jekyll-blades) by [anyblades](https://github.com/anyblades)

**Disclaimer**

These third-party resources are not necessarily reviewed by the Sveltia CMS team. We are not responsible for their maintenance or support. Please contact the respective authors for any issues or questions.

### Examples

See real-world examples of Jekyll integrations in our [Showcase](https://sveltiacms.app/en/showcase?framework=jekyll). Most of the listed sites include links to their source code, so you can explore how they implemented Sveltia CMS with Jekyll.

### Setup

#### Adding the Admin Page

Jekyll copies any file without front matter to the generated site as is, so the admin folder can be placed in the root of your project. Create `admin/index.html` and `admin/config.yml` as described in the [Getting Started](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/start#manual-installation) guide, and make sure the `admin` folder is not listed in the [`exclude`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/) option of `_config.yml`. The admin page is then available at `/admin/` on the development server started with `jekyll serve` as well as on the built site.

### Configuration

#### Blog Posts

Jekyll requires [posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) in the `_posts` folder to be named `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`, such as `2026-10-01-hello-world.md`. Files that don’t follow this pattern are ignored. To create matching file names, add the date to the [entry slug](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/slugs#defining-entry-slugs). The following example builds the date prefix from a DateTime field named `date` with the [`date` transformation](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/string-transformations#date):

```yaml [admin/config.yml]
media_folder: assets/images
public_folder: /assets/images
collections:
  - name: posts
    label: Posts
    folder: _posts
    slug: "{{date | date('YYYY-MM-DD')}}-{{slug}}"
    create: true
    fields:
      - { name: layout, label: Layout, widget: hidden, default: post }
      - { name: title, label: Title }
      - { name: date, label: Date, widget: datetime, default: '{{now}}' }
      - { name: categories, label: Categories, widget: list, required: false }
      - { name: tags, label: Tags, widget: list, required: false }
      - { name: body, label: Body, widget: markdown }
```

If you don’t need a `date` field, the `{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}-{{slug}}` template creates the prefix from the entry creation date instead.

The Hidden field adds `layout: post` to every new post without showing it in the Content Editor. You can remove it if you set the default layout with [front matter defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/front-matter-defaults/) in `_config.yml`.

**Changing the Date of a Saved Post**

The file name is set when a post is first saved. If an editor changes the date of an existing post later, the `date` property in the front matter takes precedence, but the file name and the post URL derived from it keep the original date. To keep them in sync, update the date in the slug from the [Slug panel](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/ui/content-editor#slug-panel), which renames the file. Since Jekyll’s default post URLs include the date, consider setting up [entry redirects](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/previews#customizing-the-redirect-property) with the `jekyll-redirect-from` plugin so the old URL keeps working.

#### Drafts

[Drafts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts) are stored in the `_drafts` folder without a date in the file name and are only built with the `--drafts` option. If you want editors to manage drafts, add another collection with `folder: _drafts` and the default slug. Publishing a draft means moving the file to `_posts` with a date prefix, which needs to be done outside the CMS. Alternatively, use the [Editorial Workflow](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/workflows/editorial) to review posts before they’re published.

#### Data Files

[Data files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) in the `_data` folder can be managed with a [file collection](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/files). A data file whose top level is a list, such as `_data/members.yml`, can be edited with a [top-level List field](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/fields/list#top-level-list).

### Support for Jekyll

We have implemented specific features to enhance the integration of Sveltia CMS with Jekyll:

- [ASCII slugs](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/slugs#global-slug-options): Set the `encoding` slug option to `ascii` to transliterate non-ASCII characters, which can otherwise break Jekyll builds. ([Discussion](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/discussions/544))
- [Nested collections](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/nested): Manage a folder tree of [pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/) in the sidebar with the `subfolders: false` mode, where every file is a page at its own path and editors can create new folders as needed.
- [Entry redirects](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/previews#customizing-the-redirect-property): Use the `aliases_field` option to store previous paths in the `redirect_from` property expected by the [`jekyll-redirect-from`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) plugin, which is updated when the entry slug is changed in Sveltia CMS.
- [Top-level List field](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/fields/list#top-level-list): Use the `root` option to edit a [data file](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) whose top level is a list, such as a list of members.
- [Localizing entry slugs](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/i18n/slugs#localizing-entry-slugs): Generate localized slugs for multilingual Jekyll sites, using the `ref` property as the canonical slug key.

## Middleman Integration Guide

This guide provides resources and information for integrating Sveltia CMS with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), a static site generator using Ruby.

### Examples

See real-world examples of Middleman integrations in our [Showcase](https://sveltiacms.app/en/showcase?framework=middleman). Most of the listed sites include links to their source code, so you can explore how they implemented Sveltia CMS with Middleman.

### Setup

#### Adding the Admin Page

All the files that make up a Middleman site live in the [`source` folder](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/directory-structure/). Create `source/admin/index.html` and `source/admin/config.yml` as described in the [Getting Started](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/start#manual-installation) guide.

Middleman applies the site [layout](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/layouts/) to every HTML file in the `source` folder, which would break the admin page. Turn off the layout for the admin folder in `config.rb`:

```ruby [config.rb]
page '/admin/*', layout: false
```

The admin page is then available at `/admin/` on the development server started with `middleman server` as well as on the built site.

### Configuration

Blog posts are usually managed with the [middleman-blog](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/) extension. Its `sources` option defines the file name pattern for posts, which includes the post date by default:

```ruby [config.rb]
activate :blog do |blog|
  blog.prefix = 'blog'
  blog.sources = '{year}-{month}-{day}-{title}.html'
end
```

With this configuration, posts are stored in `source/blog` with names like `2026-10-01-hello-world.html.md`. The matching Sveltia CMS entry collection needs three options to follow the pattern:

- `slug` creates the date prefix from the [slug template tags](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/slugs#slug-template-tags) `{{year}}`, `{{month}}` and `{{day}}`, which are based on the entry creation date.
- `extension` is set to `html.md`, because Middleman uses the double extension to determine the output format (`html`) and the template engine (Markdown).
- `format` is set to `frontmatter` so the files are read as Markdown with front matter despite the custom extension.

```yaml [source/admin/config.yml]
media_folder: source/images/uploads
public_folder: /images/uploads
collections:
  - name: blog
    label: Blog
    folder: source/blog
    slug: '{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}-{{slug}}'
    extension: html.md
    format: frontmatter
    create: true
    fields:
      - { name: title, label: Title }
      - { name: tags, label: Tags, widget: list, required: false }
      - { name: published, label: Published, widget: boolean, default: true }
      - { name: body, label: Body, widget: markdown }
```

`title` is the only required front matter property in middleman-blog, and posts with `published: false` are treated as drafts that only appear on the development server.

The post date is taken from the file name. If you also want editors to set the date, add a DateTime field named `date` and build the slug from it with the [`date` transformation](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/string-transformations#date), so the file name follows the selected date instead of the creation date:

```yaml
slug: "{{date | date('YYYY-MM-DD')}}-{{slug}}"
```

Keep in mind that middleman-blog stops the build if the date in the front matter doesn’t match the one in the file name. The file name is set when a post is first saved, so if an editor changes the date of an existing post, they also need to update the date in the slug from the [Slug panel](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/ui/content-editor#slug-panel), which renames the file.

## Zola Integration Guide

This guide provides resources and information for integrating Sveltia CMS with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a fast static site generator written in Rust.

### Starter Templates

Here are some starter templates built by the community using Zola:

- [Zola Sveltia Source](https://github.com/unicornfantasian/zola-sveltia-source) by [husenunicorn](https://github.com/husenunicorn)

**Disclaimer**

These third-party resources are not necessarily reviewed by the Sveltia CMS team. We are not responsible for their maintenance or support. Please contact the respective authors for any issues or questions.

### Examples

See real-world examples of Zola integrations in our [Showcase](https://sveltiacms.app/en/showcase?framework=zola). Most of the listed sites include links to their source code, so you can explore how they implemented Sveltia CMS with Zola.

### Setup

#### Adding the Admin Page

Zola serves static files from the [`static` folder](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/directory-structure/#static). Create `static/admin/index.html` and `static/admin/config.yml` as described in the [Getting Started](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/start#manual-installation) guide. The admin page is then available at `/admin/` on the development server started with `zola serve` as well as on the built site.

### Configuration

Zola stores content in the `content` folder, where each subfolder with an `_index.md` file is a [section](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/), and the other Markdown files in it are [pages](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/). The following example manages the pages of a blog section in `content/blog`:

```yaml [static/admin/config.yml]
media_folder: static/images
public_folder: /images
collections:
  - name: blog
    label: Blog
    folder: content/blog
    format: toml-frontmatter
    create: true
    fields:
      - { name: title, label: Title }
      - { name: date, label: Date, widget: datetime, type: date }
      - { name: description, label: Description, required: false }
      - { name: draft, label: Draft, widget: boolean, default: false }
      - name: taxonomies
        label: Taxonomies
        widget: object
        fields:
          - { name: tags, label: Tags, widget: list, required: false }
      - name: extra
        label: Extra
        widget: object
        required: false
        fields:
          - { name: image, label: Image, widget: image, required: false }
      - { name: body, label: Body, widget: markdown }
```

Some notes on this configuration:

- Zola’s [front matter](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/#front-matter) is usually written in TOML with `+++` delimiters, so the `format` option is set to `toml-frontmatter`. YAML front matter is also supported by Zola, in which case the option can be omitted.
- Zola accepts a `date` in the `YYYY-MM-DD` or RFC 3339 format. The `type: date` option of the DateTime field saves a date without time. If you need the time as well, remove the `type` option and add `output_utc: true` so the value is saved with a time zone, as required by RFC 3339.
- Taxonomy terms like tags are stored in the `taxonomies` table, using the taxonomy names defined in `zola.toml`, so an [Object](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/fields/object) field is used to group them. Custom properties go in the `extra` table in the same way.
- The section’s own `_index.md` file is not part of this collection. You can manage it with the [`index_file`](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/listings#managing-hugo-s-special-index-file) collection option or a [file collection](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/files).

### Support for Zola

We have implemented specific features to enhance the integration of Sveltia CMS with Zola:

- [Entry-relative media folders](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/media/internal#using-entry-relative-folders): Store media files in folders relative to their associated entries, following Zola’s [asset colocation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/overview/#asset-colocation) convention.
- [Nested collections](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/nested): Manage a tree of [sections](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/) as a folder tree in the sidebar, where each entry is stored as an `_index.md` file in its own folder and can be moved along with its children.
- [Entry redirects](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/previews#redirects): Out-of-the-box support for Zola’s [`aliases` front matter property](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/#front-matter), which is updated when the entry slug is changed in Sveltia CMS.
- [Manual entry reordering](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries/operations#reordering-entries): Use the `reorder` option to add the [`weight` property](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/#weight) to entries for controlling their order in Zola.
- The [`value_type`](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/fields/number#value-type) number field option supports `int/string` and `float/string` value types, which are useful for Zola sites that store numbers as strings in front matter. ([Discussion](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues/574))
- The [`omit_default_locale_from_file_path`](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/i18n/options#top-level-configuration) i18n option allows omitting the locale suffix from filenames for entries in the default locale, which is useful for [multilingual Zola sites](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/multilingual/). ([Discussion](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/discussions/394))
