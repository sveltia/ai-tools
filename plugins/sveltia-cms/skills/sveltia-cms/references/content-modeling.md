# Content Modeling

Planning collections and fields for a site, with complete example configurations for common site types: blogs, documentation, portfolios, corporate, personal, event, music, recipe, education and nonprofit sites. The examples are shown in YAML only; see `config.md` for the TOML, JSON and JavaScript equivalents.

## Content Modeling Guide

Sveltia CMS is a generic-purpose content management system that can be adapted to various use cases. How to structure your collections and design your content models depends on your project requirements. Here are some guidelines and examples to help you get started.

### Planning Your Content Model

Content modeling is primarily a non-technical task that requires understanding of your content and how it will be used. It’s recommended to involve content editors and stakeholders in the planning process to ensure the content model meets everyone’s needs. If you are building a site for a client, collaborate with them to understand their content requirements and workflows.

### Understanding Content Models

A content model defines the structure and organization of your content within Sveltia CMS. It consists of [collections](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections), which are groups of related content items, and [fields](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/fields), which define the properties of each content item.

When designing your content model, consider the following:

- **Content types**: Identify the different types of content you need to manage (e.g., blog posts, products, pages).
- **Collections**: Decide whether to use [entry collections](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries) (for multiple similar items) or [file collections](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/files) (for individual files) based on your content types.
- **Fields**: Define the fields required for each content type, including their data types and validation rules.
- **Relationships**: Determine if there are any relationships between different content types that need to be represented (e.g., authors for blog posts, categories for products).

### Tips for Designing Content Models

Some best practices for designing effective content models in Sveltia CMS include:

- **Plan ahead**: Take the time to think through your content structure before creating collections and fields. This will help avoid unnecessary changes later.
- **Keep it simple**: Start with a basic structure and expand as needed. Avoid overcomplicating your content model.
- **Use meaningful names**: Choose clear and descriptive names for collections and fields to make it easier to understand.
- **Leverage field types**: Utilize the [various field types](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/fields#field-types) available in Sveltia CMS to capture different kinds of data effectively.
- **Plan for scalability**: Consider how your content model may need to evolve over time and design it to accommodate future changes.
- **Test and iterate**: Regularly review and refine your content model based on feedback from content editors and users.

### Using Relations Between Collections

Sveltia CMS supports [Relation fields](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/fields/relation) that allow you to create relationships between different collections. This is useful for linking related content items, such as associating blog posts with authors or products with categories.

When using relations, consider the following:

- **Cardinality**: Decide whether the relationship is one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, and configure the Relation field accordingly.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the potential performance implications of complex relationships, especially with large datasets.
- **User experience**: Ensure that the relationship is intuitive for content editors, providing clear labels and options in the CMS interface.

### Examples of Content Models

Here are some common content models for different types of websites and applications, along with suggestions on how to structure your collections and fields.

#### Blog or News Site

- **Posts**: [entry collection](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries) for blog posts or news articles, organized by date and linked to tags and authors via Relation fields. A status field keeps unfinished posts off the site. For a review process with pull requests, consider the [Editorial Workflow](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/workflows/editorial) instead.
- **Tags**: entry collection for managing available tags, linked to posts via a Relation field. For more details, see our [how-to](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/how-tos#using-entry-tags-for-categorization) on this topic.
- **Authors**: entry collection for managing the list of authors, linked to posts via a Relation field.
- **Pages**: [file collection](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/files) for static pages like About or Contact.

#### Personal Website

- **Posts**: [entry collection](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries) for blog posts. Unlike the blog example above, tags are entered freely in a simple [List](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/fields/list) field instead of being managed in a separate collection, which is enough for a small site with a single author.
- **Projects**: entry collection for personal projects or side projects.
- **About**, **Contact**, and **Site Settings**: [singletons](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/singletons) for one-off pages and site-wide settings like the site title, description, and social links. Singletons appear directly in the sidebar, so they are easier to reach than files in a file collection when there are only a few of them.

#### Event Management Site

- **Events**: [entry collection](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/entries) for events, linked to categories, locations, and organizers via Relation fields. Whether an event is upcoming or past is determined by its date, so only cancellation needs to be set manually.
- **Categories**: entry collection for event categories (e.g., Conference, Webinar, Workshop), linked to events via a Relation field.
- **Locations**: entry collection for available venues, linked to events via a Relation field.
- **Organizers**: entry collection for event organizers, linked to events via a Relation field.
- **Speakers**: entry collection for event speakers.
- **Sessions**: entry collection for event sessions, linked to events and speakers via Relation fields. Each session points to its event, rather than each event listing its sessions, so that adding a session doesn’t require editing the event.
- **Sponsors**: entry collection for event sponsors, linked to events via a Relation field.
- **Pages**: [file collection](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/collections/files) for static pages like Event Guidelines or FAQ.
